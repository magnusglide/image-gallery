# image-gallery
Created a Image Gallery with Vanilla JS to upload all images from the folder automatically. Made page responsive with CSS media queries. Added prefetching to faster download images even in 2-3 K resolution. 

When you are on the 1st page - the images are already downloading on your device. So when you go to the next page - Gallery, you will not see any downloading of the images.
It is one of the best User Experiences that I have made.

P.S. I have added prefetching because I read about it on Netflix blog. They have improved their UE with prefetching.
