# image-gallery
Created an Image Gallery with Vanilla JS to upload all images from the folder automatically. Made page responsive with CSS media queries. Added prefetching to faster download images even in 2-3 K resolution. 

When you are on the 1st page - the images are already downloading on your device. So when you go to the next page - Gallery, you will not see any downloading of the images.
Although the Gallery page is the main for this project - For the Team page I implemented 3D effect only with CSS.

P.S. I added prefetching because I read about it on Netflix tech blog. They have improved their UX with prefetching.
